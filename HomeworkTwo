# You may do your work by editing this file, or by typing code at the
# command line and copying it into the appropriate part of this file when
# you are done.  When you are done, running this file should compute and
# print the answers to all the problems.


###
### Problem 1
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 1 solution follows:"

from hw2_test.py import n
num = 0
i = 1

while i < (n +1):
      num = (num + 1)
      i = (i + 1)
print num

#the following is another way to get the same answer...

x = 1
ans = 0
itersLeft = x
while (itersLeft !=0):
    ans = ans + x
    itersLeft = itersLeft - 1
print sum (range(101))

###
### Problem 2
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 2 solution follows:"

import math
from fractions import Fraction
from decimal import Decimal

n=1.0
for ans in (range(11)):
   if ans > 1: 
       print "Fraction:"
       print str (Fraction(n/ans))
       print "Decimal of above Fraction:"
       print str (Decimal(n/ans))
        
# Why are some of the fractions and decimals wrong?

###
### Problem 3
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 3 solution follows:"

n = 10
triangular = 0
for i in range(11):
    triangular = sum (range(11))
print "Triangular number", n, "via loop:", triangular
print "Triangular number", n, "via formula:", (n*(n+1))/2

###
### Problem 4
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 4 solution follows:"

n = 10
fact = 1
for i in range (2, n +1):
    fact = fact * i
print "Factorial of", n, "via for loop:", str(fact)

print "Factorial of", n, "via function:", math.factorial(n)

###
### Problem 5
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 5 solution follows:"

for i in xrange (10, 0, -1):
    if i>0:
        print str(math.factorial(i))

###
### Problem 6
###

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 6 solution follows:"

n = 10
a = 1
for i in xrange (10, 0, -1):
    a = a + (1.0/math.factorial(i))
print a

# Python cares about white space

###
### Collaboration
###

# I utilized multiple web resources, including Khan Academy and stackoverflow. 
# I also relied heavily on "Introduction to Computation and Programming Using 
# Python"

###
### Reflection
###

# This assignment took me about 3.5 hours...
# The readings were helpful and last week's lecture was helpful with the first
# for loop...otherwise I was sort of on my own with the internet...
